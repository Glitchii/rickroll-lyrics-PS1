###  
The first time after cloning, cd into `rickroll-lyrics-PS1` and  run `source setup.sh`. Run this only once after cloning the repo.
That should simply setup everything for you.

`source roll` starts rickroll if not already started. The `roll` script would have been inserted in '~/.local/bin/' by the setup script.  
`source roll -r` resets everything.

You can also type `rick` to output a lyric without changing the terminal name or host in a new terminal.
Use `rick -r` to reset next lyric line index to 0
