###  
The first time after cloning, cd into `rickroll-lyrics-PS1` and  run `bash setup.sh`. Run this only once after cloning the repo.
  
  
You can then open a new terminal or source the bashrc file then you can type `roll` to enable, or `roll -r` to reset back to default.
If the script is complete successfully, you can also type `rick` to output a lyric without changing the terminal name or host in a new terminal.
